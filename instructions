1. Downlod the tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip file.
2. Create a folder in your C drive named "tcc"
3. Move the tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip file to the "tcc" folder.
4. Extract tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip file.
5. There will be a "tcc" folder in our "tcc" folder.
6. Open the "tcc" folder inside out folder.
7. Copy the path and set it as your system environment variable.
8. Open "cmd" nd type tcc.
You should see the output as:
